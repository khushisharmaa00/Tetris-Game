This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by filling rows with blocks. The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the grid.
The game consists of:

1) A grid (20 rows x 10 columns) displayed using an HTML <canvas>.
2) Seven tetromino shapes (I, L, O, S, Z, P, and Square) that fall one at a time and can be rotated, moved left/right, or dropped down by the player using arrow keys.
3) A score system that increases as rows are cleared.
